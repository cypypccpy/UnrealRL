Usage in the Editor
======================

In UE4 editor, you can run UnrealCV command, edit the scene and change the material properties. We show a few examples here using the scene
`RealisticRendering <http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/develop/reference/model_zoo.html#realisticrendering>`_.

Run UnrealCV Command
--------------------

While playing the level in the editor, press ` to open the built-in console and run UnrealCV like in the game binary.
